Examples include:

- BluetoothAdvertiser    
- BluetoothScanner
- BluetoothGatt


BluetoothAdvertiser    
--------------------------

This sample demonstrates use of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Advertisement APIs.

**BluetoothAdvertiser** allows the user to toggle BLE Advertising of that device. 
It broadcasts basic information about the device along with a UUID specific to this app so the Scanner on other devices can filter by it.

BluetoothScanner    
--------------------------

This sample demonstrates use of the Bluetooth APIs.
**BluetoothScanner** allow the user to scan the device which is BLE or BR/EDR .

BluetoothGatt    
--------------------------

This sample demonstrates how to use the Bluetooth LE Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) to transmit data between devices.
The functionality is split into two activities - one for GATT client, one for GATT server.

You will need two devices to see this sample in action.
